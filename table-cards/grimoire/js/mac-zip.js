/* mac-zip.js -- read a zip archive: its central directory, each file stored or
   deflated, and the resource fork and Finder type a Mac keeps beside a file.
   =========================================================================

   WHY A ZIP READER, IN A TREE ABOUT CLASSIC MAC FILES. Two reasons, and the
   second is the one that matters. One of the community's add-ons, Rocky the
   Flying Chicken, is a .zip holding two saved games. And a saved game shared
   today arrives as one: the Finder's Compress and the Files app's Compress
   both make a zip, so a player on a phone who is sent a save gets a zip and
   has no way to take the file out of it before handing it to this page.

   WHAT IT READS. The end-of-central-directory record, found by scanning back
   from the end of the file past any comment; the central directory, which is
   the authority for every entry's sizes, CRC and method (a local header
   written before its data may hold zeroes and a data descriptor after it);
   and each entry's local header, only for where its data starts. Stored
   (method 0) and deflated (method 8) entries are read; every other method is
   named and refused, as are encrypted entries, split archives and Zip64.
   Every entry read is held to the CRC-32 the directory carries for it, which
   is the format's own checksum and the only thing that tells a correct
   inflate from a plausible one.

   THE MAC PART. A zip has nowhere to put a resource fork or a Finder type, so
   a Mac writes them as an AppleDouble file beside the real one: `._name` in
   the same folder, or, from the Finder and `ditto --sequesterRsrc`, the same
   path under a top-level `__MACOSX/`. Those entries are read here, joined to
   the file they describe, and taken out of the entry list, so a caller sees
   one file with `type`, `creator` and a resource fork, the way a StuffIt entry
   looks (js/mac-stuffit.js). An `._` entry that does not hold AppleDouble is
   left in the list as an ordinary file.

   NAMES. UTF-8 when the entry's flag says so, and also when the bytes are
   valid UTF-8 without it, because the Finder writes UTF-8 names and does not
   set the flag. Otherwise Mac Roman: a zip made on a classic Mac is the case
   this page cares about, and a name that is not valid UTF-8 is far likelier
   to be Mac Roman than the IBM code page the specification names.

   THE INFLATER is `inflateRaw` in js/mac-vise.js, the one the installer
   reader uses. Not repeated here: two classic scripts share one
   global scope, and a second DEFLATE decoder would be a second thing to be
   wrong. The browser player defines an async `inflateRaw` of its own, so this
   file cannot be vendored there as it stands.

   LOAD ORDER: after mac-bytes.js (crc32, decodeMacRoman),
   mac-containers.js (appleSingleForks) and mac-vise.js (inflateRaw). A classic
   script, like the rest of js/: no import, no export, globals.

   Checked by utilities/zip_check.mjs: against Node's zlib, against the zips
   Info-ZIP and Apple's `ditto` write, and against `unar` on the add-on. */
