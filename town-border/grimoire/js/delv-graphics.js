/* delv-graphics.js -- Cythera's palette, its compressed-graphics decoder, and
 * the undither filter, from bytes to pixels and no further.
 *
 * Nothing in here touches the DOM. decompressDCG() and decodeResource() return
 * a plain Uint8Array of palette indices; undither() takes and returns RGBA
 * arrays. Drawing those onto a canvas is the page's job and stays there, which
 * is what makes this file checkable: utilities/delv_graphics_check.mjs runs
 * delvmod's independent decoder over every image in the archive and compares
 * pixel for pixel, and utilities/decoder_snapshot.mjs hashes the output so a
 * refactor that changes a byte is visible. Keep new code here on the same side
 * of that line -- a decoder that needs a canvas cannot be compared against a
 * Python one.
 *
 * See delv-archive.js for why these are classic scripts and why this is
 * organisation rather than a library. LOAD ORDER: after delv-archive.js, whose
 * bit readers decodeResource() uses; before the page.
 *
 * ABOUT THE PALETTE, before anyone corrects it: this table differs from the
 * application's own `clut` 256 at exactly two entries, index 0 and index 247,
 * and both differences are absorbed by the `>> 2` in scale6to8 -- the rendered
 * pixels are identical either way. The comment above scale6to8 explains why
 * the widening is done by scaling rather than the shift the original used.
 *
 * The undither block is the settled result of a long tuning exercise, and
 * The retired mobile shell (ratlizard/alchemy) carried a port of it as three GPU passes because this
 * implementation costs 5.8 s for a 640x480 frame. utilities/
 * its mobile_undither_check.mjs read UD and the detector's constants back out of
 * this file and fails if the two have drifted, so a tuning change made here
 * without touching that port was caught rather than discovered later.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   0x8EFF -- the wiki's "Tombstone" -- was being decompressed as the fixed
   32x512 strip every other 0x8Exx resource is, which produced a sheared mess:
   its rows are 196 pixels long, so reading them 32 at a time walks diagonally
   through the picture. It is a SIZED resource, the same 4-byte {width, height}
   header subindex 142 uses, and it decodes to a 194x127 tombstone slab -- the
   panel the game lays a gravestone inscription on.

   Two things have to hold before the header reading is used, and across all
   160 tile sheets in the archive only 0x8EFF passes both:

     * the header parses to a plausible picture (every other sheet's first four
       bytes read as sizes like 61693x128 or 20x61185 -- they are compression
       opcodes, not a header; only 0x8E8D at 272x46 and 0x8EFF at 194x127 are
       even arguable), and
     * none of the sixteen tile ids the sheet would occupy carries any tile
       attribute in 0xF002. 0x8E8D's sixteen are all attributed and all named
       ("earthen wall", "small hole", "fine wire"...) and all referenced by
       maps; 0x8EFF's sixteen are attributed nowhere and referenced by nothing.

   Row-to-row self-similarity confirms the reading: 0.58 flat against 0.82 at

// Palette index 0 is Delver's transparent slot. Portraits are cut-outs on

// Cythera animates water, lava and magic by palette cycling rather than by
// swapping frames: the wiki records that "colors 0xE0-0xFB inclusive are
// subject to palette animation", and Glenn Andreas describes the engine
// iterating those indices for "the lava, or waves in the water". The Andreas
// quote and the 0xE0-0xFB range are the wiki's. Where the ramps divide is no
// longer a guess: the engine masks with 0xF8 below 0xF0 and with 0xFC above
// it, which is the 8, 8, 4, 4, 4 below, and it leaves 0xFC-0xFF alone. What
// each ramp is FOR is still this tool's own reading and appears nowhere in
// the wiki:
//   E0-E7 fire/lava   E8-EF water   F0-F3 magic (the void sparkle)
//   F4-F7 earth       F8-FB nature
//
// The direction is NOT a guess and was wrong here until 14 September 2026,
// which is why the rivers ran upstream. The engine does not animate the CLUT
// at all: it builds eight 256-byte translation tables once, counts a phase
// 0..7 up by one per animation tick, and passes every pixel of the finished
// frame through the table for the current phase. The tables are built as
//   index -> (index & 0xF8) | ((index - phase) & 7)   for E0-EF
//   index -> (index & 0xFC) | ((index - phase) & 3)   for F0-FB
// and everything outside E0-FB maps to itself. So a pixel drawn as E0 shows
// E7 at phase 1, not E1: the ramp is walked DOWNWARDS as the phase rises.
// This tool had it upwards, and so does delvmod's panimate, which the two

//   3 refinement passes, detail recovery 50%, checkerboard-notch smoother,
//   stray-colour repair at 40 (inside dithered areas only, 0.65),
//   2x structure-guided upscale resampled back to native size.

/* A second set of settings, and why there are two.
 *
 * UD above was tuned by eye and by a cleaning-versus-detail-loss ratio over
 * six portraits. Both are real measures and neither is "is this the picture
 * the artist drew", because the continuous-tone original is not in the
 * archive and never was.
 *
 * utilities/undither_check.mjs makes one. ditherToCytheraPalette is the
 * forward process this repository already carries, so an image put through it
 * has a KNOWN original and the filter can be scored against the thing it is
 * trying to recover. Over four sources -- a smooth ramp, a grey-to-warm hue
 * sweep at constant lightness, fine linework, and a lit sphere -- the settings
 * above come 34th of the 36 combinations tried. These come first: RMSE 10.81
 * against 11.95, a tenth better, for 3% more error at edges.
 *
 * Both are offered rather than one replacing the other, because the two
 * measures disagree honestly. The ground truth here is recovery from THIS
 * dither; Ambrosia's artwork was made by another, and the portraits the

   Shared art: the frame around a portrait is not dithered.

   Every Cythera portrait is a face inside a frame, and the two
   are different kinds of picture. The face is continuous tone
   put into 256 colours by dithering, which is exactly what this
   filter exists to undo. The frame is pixel art -- masonry,
   gems, crossed swords, a vine with grape clusters -- drawn a
   pixel at a time, and where it alternates two colours it is
   doing so deliberately, as a pattern. Averaging that is not
   reconstruction, it is damage: the vintner's grapes came out
   as two flat magenta blobs.

   Nothing in a pixel tells you which it is, and every local
   test tried confuses them -- a checkerboard of two magentas is
   a checkerboard of two magentas whether a hand or a dither put
   it there. So the evidence is taken from the archive instead:
   a frame is DRAWN ONCE AND REUSED across the portraits that
   share it, and a face never is. Ambrosia's artists worked that
   way, and the file still shows it.

   The test is therefore whether a pixel's whole neighbourhood
   appears identically, at the same coordinates, in some other
   portrait. 5x5 rather than 3x3, which was tried first and is
   too weak: flat highlights on two different faces agree over
   3x3 by coincidence often enough to lock parts of a cheek. At
   5x5 that stops, and what is left is the frame, the vine and
   the grapes, with the face untouched.

   It is measured from the corpus rather than listed, so a
   modded archive gets its own frames and nothing here has a
   table to go stale. A portrait whose frame is unique to it
   locks nothing, which is the right answer: there is then no
   evidence, and the filter's old behaviour is what it gets.

   The frames themselves, one per family of portraits.

   The same evidence, the other way round: sharedArtMask asks which
   of one portrait's pixels some other portrait also has, and this
   asks which portraits share a frame and what the frame is. The
   maintainer asked for every shared frame to be offered in the
   ditherizer, as the grape frame of Ariethous, Dares and Diomede had
   been drawn out by hand for the sour grapes (27 September 2026).

   Two portraits are linked when at least SHARED_LINK_MIN of their
   pixels have their whole 5x5 neighbourhood alike, the lock's rule.
   Grouping is greedy from the strongest link down, and a merge is
   kept only while the group's frame stays SHARED_FRAME_MIN pixels:
   linked in chains alone, the fountain, the door and a flowering
   bush joined twenty portraits through a white margin and left a
   frame of 292 pixels, and at a strict link the twenty-five mages
   fell apart into pairs. The frame is what every member has alike
   AND reaches the picture's edge through such pixels, so a
   coincidence inside the faces is not taken for it; the rest is
   the hole. A frame shared by nobody is no family. Returns
   [{ members: [resid], image, frame }], image each pixel's commonest
   index among the members and frame a 0/1 mask with its gaps filled
   (offered, below), largest family first.

   A frame made of items.

   Meleager's family's frame is items: the axe (tile 0x203) at the
   top-left corner with its drawn pixels flush to the picture's
   corner, the same axe mirrored at the top-right, a shield at each
   foot, and swords along the top and bottom and turned along the
   sides. The maintainer asked for frames like it to be built from
   any item (27 September 2026) and chose corners and edges: one
   item at the four corners, mirrored so that each faces out as the
   axes do, and one along the four edges, as drawn along the top,
   flipped for the bottom and turned for the sides. Turned is the
   top's rows made the left side's columns, so what faces out at
   the top faces out at the side; the right side and the bottom are
   mirrors of the left and the top. An edge item lies along its
   edge, so one taller than wide is turned before any of that.

   Each item is its tile's drawn pixels cropped to their box, at
   their own size. An edge takes as many as fit between the
   corners, evenly spaced, and at least one, centred; the corners
   go on last. Index 0 is a tile's transparency and is the frame's
   too: where the result is 0 the picture shows. Takes two 32x32
   tile images, either of which may be null, and returns a W x H
   array of indices.

   Protected pixels.

   Two things are never touched by any stage:

     transparency, so the cut-out can never be dragged into the

     palette-animated indices E0-FB, whose exact values are chosen
     for their position in a runtime colour cycle and so carry
     meaning that averaging would destroy.

   There used to be a third: pixels the encoder emitted as a long
   run or a distant copy were treated as deliberate structure and
   locked. That was wrong, and measurably so. In dithered artwork
   the dither is itself what compresses into long copies — the
   encoder is matching one patch of noise against another — so
   trusting copies pinned the dither in place instead of the
   drawing. It locked 48% of one portrait and 89% of a texture,
   and scored worse on every resource class tried. Removed.

   Checkerboard notch.

   Where this artwork is dithered, the dither is usually a checkerboard — but
   not in brightness, which is why it hides from a luminance analysis. It is a
   checkerboard in WHICH RAMP each pixel is taken from: neutral greys
   interleaved with warm browns to make a desaturated skin tone. The two are
   close in lightness and far apart in hue, so the pattern is loud to the eye
   and nearly invisible to any measurement of luma.

   Measured on the choice itself, as a grey-or-brown indicator, 56% of the
   mixed patches in 0x8809 and 45% in Pelagon peak at exactly the checkerboard
   frequency. Others, like 0x8801, have almost none — it varies by resource.

   A checkerboard is the single frequency (pi,pi), so it can be removed by a
   filter that is zero there and one at DC instead of by a blur that attenuates
   everything. Half the centre plus half the mean of the four orthogonal
   neighbours does exactly that: the neighbours are all of opposite phase, so
   they cancel the pattern precisely, while a flat area passes through
   untouched. Diagonal neighbours are deliberately excluded — they share the
   centre's phase and would reinforce what we are trying to null.

   On its own it removes a third of the local variation on every portrait
   tried. It cannot tell a one-pixel pupil from one square of a checkerboard,
   so like the other smoothers it is applied through the dither detector rather
   than everywhere.

   Stray colour repair.

   Some resources carry isolated pixels in a wildly wrong hue — Erechtheus has
   69 magenta ones scattered over his face, from palette index 5 and the far
   end of the magenta ramp. They are quantisation accidents, not paint, and
   they are the most visually offensive thing left in the output because the
   eye finds an out-of-gamut dot instantly.

   Despeckle above will not do the job. It flags a pixel that is isolated and
   far from its neighbours in FULL COLOUR, and that is also an exact
   description of a pupil, which is why it takes the detail you wanted with it.

   The distinction that actually holds is hue. A pupil is extreme in
   brightness but its chroma matches its surroundings — it is a neutral dot in
   a neutral socket. A stray is extreme in chroma: it points somewhere in
   colour space that nothing near it points. Measured on Erechtheus, the
   magenta pixels sit 40 to 160 from their neighbourhood's median chroma;
   Pelagon's and Magpie's pupils sit at 0 to 15. The two populations do not
   overlap anywhere, so a threshold between them separates them completely.

   The isolation test is kept as a second condition so that a small but
   deliberate patch of colour — a gem, a coloured highlight — survives: only a
   pixel with no neighbour of its own hue is treated as an accident.

   The other direction: full colour IN, Cythera OUT.

   ditherToCytheraPalette is the deliberate inverse of the undither above.
   The undither's own analysis (see the checkerboard-notch comment) found
   that this artwork's dither is a checkerboard in WHICH RAMP each pixel is
   taken from -- greys interleaved with warm browns for skin, close in
   lightness, far in hue -- the single frequency (pi,pi). So the way to make
   an arbitrary image look like this artwork is to produce exactly that
   pattern: for each pixel, either the one palette entry nearest the target
   colour, or the better of a PAIR of entries laid out on the global
   checkerboard phase, whichever approximates it best. Pairs are ordered by
   luminance before the phase is applied, so a region that chooses the same
   pair renders as one coherent checker rather than pixel noise.

   Palette slots 0 (the transparent cut-out slot -- portraits sit on it) and
   0xE0-0xFB (the palette-cycling ramps the engine animates for lava, water
   and magic) are never chosen for opaque pixels unless asked; a portrait
   that borrowed an animated slot would shimmer with the sea.

   checker (0..1, default 0.6) sets how eagerly a pair beats a flat pixel:
   at 0 the result is plain nearest-colour quantisation; at 1 any pair that
   is at all better wins and everything shimmers with pattern.

/* ---- recolouring the hero ------------------------------------------------
   The hero and the heroine are prop types 32 and 33, and each is drawn from
   one tile sheet of sixteen 32x32 frames that nothing else in the game points
   into. A patch that replaces that one sheet therefore changes how the player
   looks and nothing else, which is what makes it the plainest demonstration
   of what a Magpie patch can do: `HERO_SPRITES` below is the table, and the
   page's section under Hackery (heroSpriteSection in page-mechanics.js) is
   what drives it.

   WHICH PIXEL IS WHICH PART IS NOT IN THE FILE. The art is flat indexed
   pixels with no layer saying "hair" or "shirt", so the table is the one part
   of this that is a judgement rather than a reading, and it was made by
   looking: every index each sheet uses was drawn in false colour, frame by
   frame, on 17 September 2026. Most indices belong to one part outright
   (`sure`). A few are shared, because the artist reached for the same brown
   to shade a forearm and to draw a belt, or the same grey for a halter and a
   boot. Those are settled per connected run of pixels: a run of shared shades
   goes to whichever part its neighbours vote for (`votes`, where a part named
   twice counts twice), and to `otherwise` when nothing it touches has a vote,
   which is what a boot that meets only the black outline and a legging looks
   like. The black outline and the two near-blacks (0x1D, 0x1E) belong to no
   part and are never recoloured, so the silhouette is the shipped one, and
   neither is anything in a figure's `fixed` list.

   The indices are this release's art. A patch or a mod that redraws the
   sheet leaves them describing pixels that are no longer there, which is why
   the page labels the file as it arrived and says what it did not recognise
   rather than recolouring a guess. */

   in the dark purples and a heavier one reached for a blue of the right

/* ---- wearing another body, and recolouring by shade -----------------------
   Two things the hero section does beyond its part table, and both are for
   any sprite rather than for the hero alone.

   WEARING A BODY. The hero is drawn as facing * 4 + pose: four facings, and
   in each the left foot forward, standing, the right foot forward and seated
   (the map view's gait reading, confirmed by Alaric on his throne at frame
   11). Every person in the file is laid out the same way, so their sixteen
   frames go straight onto the hero's. A monster is not: the program sets a
   monster's frame in TActiveMonster::AdjustAspect(facing, step), switching on
   a per-class property, and the layouts it can choose include facing * 2 +
   (step & 1), two strides a facing, and facing alone, one frame a facing,
   both with the same facing number the people use. So an eight-frame
   monster's frames are spread over the hero's four poses by HERO_WEAR_POSE
   (a stride on each foot, the first stride standing and seated, since such
   a body has no frame for either) and a four-frame one shows its one frame
   for all four. Sixteen-frame monsters are not worn: AdjustAspect has more
   than one sixteen-frame layout, the gator's frames visibly change facing
   every two, and which a class uses is the class's property 55, which
   nothing here reads yet. */

/* RECOLOURING BY SHADE. The part table is a judgement made for two sheets;
   this is the version that needs none: it finds the regions a sprite is
   painted in from the art, and a region is replaced as a whole.

   WHAT MAKES A REGION. A painted area is a ramp of shades that touch each
   other all over it, while two areas meet only along a seam. So shades are
   joined strongest contact first -- how many times two shades sit side by
   side, over the smaller one's pixel count -- down to a tenth, and two
   groups join only while they still look like one colour: the same greyness
   (a grey never joins a colour, which is what kept trousers apart from the
   skin they touch), mean hues within 18 degrees, and mean colourfulness
   within 32 in L*a*b* (skin against a vivid red). The means, not the
   members, because a ramp's dark end is less colourful than its bright end
   and the hero's shirt is both.

   TRIED AND DROPPED, all on 18 September 2026 against the fool, the hero,
   the heroine, the demon, the nobleman, a Seldane, the guard, the mage, the
   ruffian, the king, the woman and the golem:
   - the palette's rows, which was the first version: row 0x20 runs from
     yellow to red, so the fool's motley came out as one group holding most
     of him and a handful of scattered yellows (the maintainer's screenshot);
   - hue gaps alone: the warm half of the palette is a continuum, and skin,
     hair, leather and a demon's red became one group;
   - contact alone: the fool's motley is a checkerboard, so his red and
     yellow touch everywhere and joined;
   - a limit on the spread of hues over the members rather than the means:
     it broke every shaded blue in two.
   Nothing is right for every sprite. The guard's armour and his skin are one
   group, and a Seldane's robe is three.

   What is left under a fiftieth of the pixels is folded into the group it
   touches most (a buckle into its belt), or failing that the nearest in
   colour, so the list is the handful of things a person would name. The
   outline and the near-blacks are left out, as they are from the parts.

   The result is a def shaped like a HERO_SPRITES entry, one part per group
   with no shared runs, so heroPartMap and heroRemapTables take it unchanged.
   Parts are ordered by pixel count, most first; `top` is a group's most used
   index, and a group's key is its lowest index, which does not depend on
   the order the joins happened in. */
