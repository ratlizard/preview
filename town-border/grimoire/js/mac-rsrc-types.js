/* mac-rsrc-types.js -- decoders for the resource types a classic Mac file
 * actually contains: PICT, snd, NFNT, clut, cicn, crsr, ICN#, STR#, vers,
 * DITL, MENU, cfrg, CODE and the rest.
 *
 * These were the whole of the retired resource fork browser page, a separate page that
 * opened any classic Mac resource fork. That page is gone. It was more
 * general-purpose than this repository, and everything in it that Cythera
 * needs is here instead: both of Cythera's files are stuffed with these types
 * -- "Cythera Data" has 18 of them across 113 resources, and the application
 * has 52 across 339 -- so index.html reads its own resource fork with the
 * same decoders rather than sending anyone to a second tool.
 *
 * GENERIC TIER. Nothing here knows Cythera exists; this belongs beside the
 * other mac-* modules, not beside delv-*. It is Apple's formats, and the
 * palettes near the middle are Apple's standard 4- and 8-bit tables, which are
 * NOT the same thing as Cythera's own CLUT in delv-graphics.js.
 *
 * These decoders take bytes and return a value: a string, a record, or a
 * canvas already drawn. The canvas ones are the exception to the usual rule
 * that drawing stays in the page, and they earn it -- utilities/
 * rsrc_snapshot.mjs hashes what they draw, pixel for pixel, so they are as
 * checkable as the ones that return text. What is NOT here is the page's own
 * furniture: the panes, the ids, the file input. That is index.html's job.
 *
 * TWO RENAMES on the way in, because the two pages were never loaded together
 * and each had a function the other also had. A function declaration in a
 * classic script is a global binding, so the later file would simply have won:
 *
 *   samplesToWav -> pcmToWavBlob   explorer's takes (rate, samples) and
 *                                  returns bytes; this one takes
 *                                  (samples, rate, bits, channels) and returns
 *                                  a Blob. Reversed arguments, silently.
 *   hexDump      -> rsrcHexDump    js/delv-archive.js has one with a different
 *                                  offset width and no length argument.
 *
 * CLASSIC SCRIPT -- no `type="module"`. See js/mac-bytes.js for why.
 * LOAD ORDER: after mac-bytes.js and mac-media.js, whose readers and WAV
 * writer this uses; mac-resfork.js opens the fork these decode the contents of.

/* The one Delver graphic that lives in a Macintosh resource fork.

   `TILE` 282 in the application's fork is a Delver Compressed Graphics tile
   sheet -- the same 32x512 column of sixteen 32x32 tiles as the 160 sheets
   under subindex 141 of the archive, and the only resource of its type in
   either fork. It was listed and unread until 7 September 2026, though every
   piece needed to draw it was already here.

   Its art is not the game's. Comparing all sixteen tiles against the 2,376
   distinct tiles in the archive's sheets, only the two solid black ones match:
   the other fourteen -- banded walls, a lattice frieze, pillars, a starfield,
   grey stone, lava, foliage, panel frames and a pair of arrows -- appear
   nowhere in Cythera. It is art the executable carries and the shipped
   scenario never draws. It uses the animated palette slots (0xE8, 0xEC, 0xEE
   in the water cycle, and 0xF1, 0xF8), so whoever drew it was working to the
   engine's own conventions.

   Drawn as the 4x4 grid the tile-sheet galleries use, with index 0
   transparent, which is what `transparentIndexFor(141)` says for a sheet out

/* The other direction: a TrueType font from today, made fit for the game.

   sfntToTrueType gives a browser a font the classic Mac made. This gives the
   classic Mac a font the modern world made, which is a different problem: the
   Mac addresses glyphs by MAC ROMAN BYTE through a platform-1 cmap subtable,
   and a font built this century almost always carries a Unicode cmap and
   nothing else. Loaded as it stands such a font draws nothing at all in
   Cythera -- every byte the game passes misses.

   So: read whatever Unicode subtable the font has, look up the code point
   each Mac Roman byte stands for (MACROMAN_HIGH again, the same table read
   the other way round), and write a platform-1 subtable of the results. Format
   0 is the 1984 one every Mac understands and holds a byte per glyph, so it
   can only name the first 256 glyphs; a font whose Latin-1 accents live above
   that gets format 6 instead, which is also in the 1990 specification and
   which the Font Manager reads. The Unicode subtable is kept alongside, so the
   same bytes still preview in a browser.

   Layout tables (GPOS, GSUB, GDEF) and the digital signature are dropped:
   the classic rasteriser reads none of them, and they are most of the weight
   of a modern font. The name table is left as it came, since a classic Mac
   takes the family name from the FOND resource rather than from the font. */

   So a font's first picture is now the alphabet: every glyph the strike

   near enough square that the cell scaler shows it at a useful size, and the

/* The strike as a TrueType font, so it can leave here.

   `writeNFNT` puts a modern face into the game. This is the other direction
   and the one a reader asks for: the Seldane script out of the game and into
   a font a phone, a browser or a word processor can set text in. Cythera
   Guides distributes a Seldane TrueType already, traced by hand in FontForge;
   this one is derived from the strike in the reader's own file, in the
   browser, and comes out of the bytes rather than out of a drawing.

   HOW THE PIXELS BECOME OUTLINES. Every lit pixel is a square, so the glyph
   is the union of its squares, and TrueType fills by non-zero winding: any
   set of same-direction contours unions, overlaps and shared edges included.
   So no tracing is needed and none is done -- the pixels are decomposed into
   maximal rectangles (a run of lit pixels extended downward as far as the
   identical run continues) and each rectangle is one clockwise contour. The
   decomposition is only a size saving; one contour per pixel would draw the
   same glyph.

   THE GRID IS KEPT EXACT. One pixel is 64 font units and the em is the
   strike's own ascent plus descent, so the em of the 12-point strike is 896
   units and every coordinate in the font is a whole number of pixels. Set at
   14px -- the cell height -- the font draws the bitmap at its own size, and
   at any integer multiple it is the same pixels scaled. Nothing rounds.

   WHAT IS NOT INVENTED. A code the strike has no image for gets no glyph and
   no cmap entry, so the font has no space: the strike has none, the game
   draws its missing symbol for one, and the TrueType on Cythera Guides has
   none either (its cmap starts at 0x21). The missing symbol becomes glyph 0,
   .notdef, which is what a modern renderer draws in the same case. */
